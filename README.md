## Linear Regression to Predict MPG

1. Ground clearance, vehicle length, and the intercept all provided a non-random amount of variance to the mpg values in our dataset.
2. The slope of the linear model is not zero because our p-value is 5.35 x 10-11, which is much smaller than our assumed significance level of 0.05%, so there is sufficient evidence to reject our null hypothesis.
