## Linear Regression to Predict MPG
![Multiple regression](https://github.com/secicciari/MechaCar_Statistical_Analysis/blob/main/resources/multiple_regression.PNG)
1. Ground clearance, vehicle length, and the intercept all provided a non-random amount of variance to the mpg values in our dataset.
2. The slope of the linear model is not zero because our p-value is 5.35 x 10-11, which is much smaller than our assumed significance level of 0.05%, so there is sufficient evidence to reject our null hypothesis.

## Summary Statistics on Suspension Coils

![Total summary](https://github.com/secicciari/MechaCar_Statistical_Analysis/blob/main/resources/total_summary.PNG)
Based on the current manufacturing data as shown above, across the manufacturing lots in total the design specification is being met because the variance is 62.3 PSI, which is less than 100.
However, when we look at Lot 3 individually it does not appear to meet the specification, because the variance is 170.3 PSI.
